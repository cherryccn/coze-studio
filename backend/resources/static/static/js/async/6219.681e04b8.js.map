Shell.stack (widget), all persistent widgets need to be stacked\n * 4. Sequentially restore panels and layouts\n *\n * -------------------- running --------------------\n * 5. widget disposed, save state in innerState\n * 6. When the widget is created, backfill the data from innerState\n * (Note that this is all about interacting with memory and has nothing to do with persistent data sources.)\n *\n * -------------------- destroy --------------------\n * 7. Read the layoutData before the application is destroyed, and store it in the persistent data source together with innerState\n *   7.1.
